        <h2 style={subheadingStyle}>üìú Our History</h2>
        <p>
          Koala Tshirts was founded in 2020 in the heart of Sydney with a simple
          mission: to create fun, stylish, and high-quality t-shirts that
          represent the Aussie spirit. Starting as a small local project between
          a couple of friends, the brand quickly gained popularity thanks to its
          iconic koala designs and commitment to comfort and sustainability.
        </p>
        <p>
          From weekend markets to a full-fledged online store, Koala Tshirts has
          grown into a proudly Australian-owned business, delivering smiles and
          style all across the country.
